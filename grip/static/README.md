Grip Static Files
=================

This is a placeholder directory for static files. You can
place CSS files here to override styles locally.

For example, to use [example.css](example.css), which makes
all headers red and gives paragraphs a red background, do
the following.

1. Create a `settings_local.py` file in the application root. That is,
   in the same directory that `settings.py` is.
2. Add `STYLE_URLS = ['/static/example.css']`

That's all there is to it.
