Grip -- GitHub Readme Instant Preview
=====================================

Render local readme files before sending off to GitHub.

Grip is a command-line server application written in Python that uses the
[GitHub markdown API][markdown] to render a local readme file. The styles also
come directly from GitHub, so you'll know exactly how it will appear.


Motivation
----------

Sometimes you just want to see the exact readme
result before committing and pushing to GitHub.

Especially when doing [Readme-driven development][rdd].


Installation
------------

To install grip, simply:

```bash
$ pip install grip
```


Usage
-----

To render the readme of a repository:

```bash
$ cd myrepo
$ grip
 * Running on http://localhost:5000/
```

Now open a browser and visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

You can also specify a port:

```bash
$ grip 80
 * Running on http://localhost:80/
```

Or an explicit file:

```bash
$ grip AUTHORS.md
 * Running on http://localhost:5000/
```

Alternatively, you could just run `grip` and visit [localhost:5000/AUTHORS.md][AUTHORS.md]
since grip supports relative URLs.

You can even bypass the server and export to a single HTML:

```bash
$ grip --export AUTHORS.md
```

GitHub-Flavored Markdown is also supported, with an optional repository context for linking to issues:

```bash
$ grip --gfm --context=joeyespo/grip
 * Running on http://localhost:5000/
```

For more details, see the help:

```bash
$ grip -h
```


API
---

You can access the API directly with Python, using it in your own projects:

```python
from grip import serve

serve(port=8080)
 * Running on http://localhost:8080/
```

Or access the underlying Flask application for even more flexibility:

```python
from grip import create_app

grip_app = create_app(gfm=True)
# Use in your own app
```


### Documentation

#### serve

Runs a local server and renders the Readme file located
at `path` when visited in the browser.

```python
serve(path='file-or-directory', host='localhost', port=5000, gfm=False, context=None, username=None, password=None, app_dir=None, render_offline=False)
```

- `path`: The filename to render, or the directory containing your Readme file
- `host`: The host to serve on
- `port`: The port to serve on
- `gfm`: Whether to render using [GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm]
- `context`: The project context to use when `gfm` is true, which
             takes the form of `username/project`
- `username`: The user to authenticate with GitHub to extend the API limit
- `password`: The password to authenticate with GitHub to extend the API limit
- `app_dir`: The directory to hold the Flask app instance
- `render_offline`: Whether to render locally using [Python-Markdown][] (Note: this is a work in progress)


#### export

Writes the specified Readme file to an HTML file with styles inlined.

```python
export(path='file-or-directory', gfm=False, context=None, username=None, password=None, render_offline=False, out_filename=None)
```

- `path`: The filename to render, or the directory containing your Readme file
- `gfm`: Whether to render using [GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm]
- `context`: The project context to use when `gfm` is true, which
             takes the form of `username/project`
- `username`: The user to authenticate with GitHub to extend the API limit
- `password`: The password to authenticate with GitHub to extend the API limit
- `render_offline`: Whether to render locally using [Python-Markdown][] (Note: this is a work in progress)
- `out_filename`: The filename to write to, `<in_filename>.html` by default


#### create_app

Creates a Flask application you can use to render and serve the Readme files.
This is the same app used by `serve` and `export` and initializes the cache,
using the cached styles when available.

```python
create_app(path='file-or-directory', gfm=False, context=None, username=None, password=None, app_dir=None, render_offline=False, render_inline=False)
```

- `path`: The filename to render, or the directory containing your Readme file
- `gfm`: Whether to render using [GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm]
- `context`: The project context to use when `gfm` is true, which
             takes the form of `username/project`
- `username`: The user to authenticate with GitHub to extend the API limit
- `password`: The password to authenticate with GitHub to extend the API limit
- `app_dir`: The directory to hold the Flask app instance
- `render_offline`: Whether to render locally using [Python-Markdown][] (Note: this is a work in progress)
- `render_inline`: Whether to inline the styles within the HTML file


#### render_app

```python
render_app(app, route='/')
```

- `app`: The Flask application to render
- `route`: The route to render, '/' by default


#### render_content

Renders the specified markdown text without caching.

```python
render_content(text, gfm=False, context=None, username=None, password=None, render_offline=False)
```

- `text`: The content to render
- `gfm`: Whether to render using [GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm]
- `context`: The project context to use when `gfm` is true, which
             takes the form of `username/project`
- `username`: The user to authenticate with GitHub to extend the API limit
- `password`: The password to authenticate with GitHub to extend the API limit
- `render_offline`: Whether to render locally using [Python-Markdown][] (Note: this is a work in progress)


#### render_page

Renders the specified markdown text without caching and outputs an HTML
page that resembles the GitHub Readme view.

```python
render_page(text, filename=None, gfm=False, context=None, username=None, password=None, render_offline=False, style_urls=[], styles=[])
```

- `text`: The content to render
- `gfm`: Whether to render using [GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm]
- `context`: The project context to use when `gfm` is true, which
             takes the form of `username/project`
- `username`: The user to authenticate with GitHub to extend the API limit
- `password`: The password to authenticate with GitHub to extend the API limit
- `render_offline`: Whether to render offline using [Python-Markdown][] (Note: this is a work in progress)
- `style_urls`: A list of URLs that contain CSS to include in the rendered page
- `styles`: A list of style content strings to inline in the rendered page


#### supported_extensions

The supported extensions, as defined by [GitHub][markdown].

```python
supported_extensions = ['.md', '.markdown']
```


#### default_filenames

This constant contains the names Grip looks for when no file is provided.

```python
default_filenames = map(lambda ext: 'README' + ext, supported_extensions)
```
