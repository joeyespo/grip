Grip -- GitHub Readme Instant Preview
=====================================

[![Current version on PyPI](http://img.shields.io/pypi/v/grip.svg)][pypi]
[![Say Thanks!](https://img.shields.io/badge/Say%20Thanks-!-1EAEDB.svg)](https://saythanks.io/to/joeyespo)

Render local readme files before sending off to GitHub.

Grip is a command-line server application written in Python that uses the
[GitHub markdown API][markdown] to render a local readme file. The styles
and rendering come directly from GitHub, so you'll know exactly how it will appear.
Changes you make to the Readme will be instantly reflected in the browser without
requiring a page refresh.


Motivation
----------

Sometimes you just want to see the exact readme
result before committing and pushing to GitHub.

Especially when doing [Readme-driven development][rdd].


Installation
------------

To install grip, simply:

```console
$ pip install grip
```

On OS X, you can also install with Homebrew:

```console
$ brew install grip
```


Usage
-----

To render the readme of a repository:

```console
$ cd myrepo
$ grip
 * Running on http://localhost:6419/
```

Now open a browser and visit [http://localhost:6419](http://localhost:6419/).
Or run with `-b` and Grip will open a new browser tab for you.

You can also specify a port:

```console
$ grip 80
 * Running on http://localhost:80/
```

Or an explicit file:

```console
$ grip AUTHORS.md
 * Running on http://localhost:6419/
```

Alternatively, you could just run `grip` and visit [localhost:6419/AUTHORS.md][AUTHORS.md]
since grip supports relative URLs.

You can combine the previous examples. Or specify a hostname instead of a port. Or provide both.

```console
$ grip AUTHORS.md 80
 * Running on http://localhost:80/
```

```console
$ grip CHANGES.md 0.0.0.0
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:6419/
```

```console
$ grip . 0.0.0.0:80
 * Running on http://0.0.0.0:80/
```

You can even bypass the server and **export** to a single HTML file, with all the styles and assets inlined:

```console
$ grip --export
Exporting to README.html
```

Control the output name with the second argument:

```console
$ grip README.md --export index.html
Exporting to index.html
```

If you're exporting a bunch of files, you can prevent styles from being inlining to save space with `--no-inline`:

```console
$ grip README.md --export --no-inline introduction.html
Exporting to introduction.html
```

Reading and writing from **stdin** and **stdout** is also supported, allowing you to use Grip with other programs:

```console
$ cat README.md | grip -
 * Running on http://localhost:6419/
```

```console
$ grip AUTHORS.md --export - | bcat
```

```console
$ cat README.md | grip --export - | less
```

This allows you to quickly test how things look by entering Markdown directly in your terminal:

```console
$ grip -
Hello **world**!
^D
 * Running on http://localhost:6419/
```

*Note: `^D` means `Ctrl+D`, which works on Linux and OS X. On Windows you'll have to use `Ctrl+Z`.*

Rendering as user-content like **comments** and **issues** is also supported, with an optional repository context for linking to issues:

```console
$ grip --user-content --context=joeyespo/grip
 * Running on http://localhost:6419/
```

For more details and additional options, see the help:

```console
$ grip -h
```


Access
------

Grip strives to be as close to GitHub as possible. To accomplish this, grip
uses [GitHub's Markdown API][markdown] so that changes to their rendering
engine are reflected immediately without requiring you to upgrade grip.
However, because of this you may hit the API's hourly rate limit. If this
happens, grip offers a way to access the API using your credentials
to unlock a much higher rate limit.

```console
$ grip --user <your-username> --pass <your-password>
```

Or use a [personal access token][] with an empty scope (note that a token is
*required* if your GitHub account is set up with two-factor authentication):

```console
$ grip --pass <token>
```

You can persist these options [in your local configuration](#configuration).
For security purposes, it's highly recommended that you **use an access token
over a password**. (You could also keep your password safe by configuring
Grip to [grab your password from a password manager][keychain-access].)

There's also a [work-in-progress branch][offline-renderer] to provide
**offline rendering**. Once this resembles GitHub more precisely, it'll
be exposed in the CLI, and will ultimately be used as a seamless fallback
engine for when the API can't be accessed.

Grip always accesses GitHub over HTTPS,
so your README and credentials are protected.


Theming
-------

Grip supports the three standard GitHub themes: `Light`, `Dark`, and `Dark dimmed`.
By default Grip uses the `Light` theme. You can change the theme in several ways;
note that the valid theme values are `light`, `dark`, and `dark_dimmed` (all lowercase).

- **Configuration** — You can change the default theme in the [config file](#configuration)
  by setting the `THEME` variable.

- **CLI** — You can set the theme by running `grip --theme=<theme>` on the command line.

- **Live** — You can dynamically set the theme of non-user content within the generated web page.
At the right of the title banner at the top is a “Theme” menu which can be used to
change the theme.

#### Create a local mirror of a Github Wiki

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.wiki.git
$ cd YOUR_REPOSITORY.wiki
$ grip
```

*By [Joshua Gourneau](https://twitter.com/gourneau/status/636329126643658753).*


#### Generate HTML documentation from a collection of linked README files

1. Enter the directory:

   ```console
   $ cd YOUR_DIR
   $ export GRIPURL=$(pwd)
   ```

2. Include all assets by setting the `CACHE_DIRECTORY` [config variable](#configuration):

   ```console
   $ echo "CACHE_DIRECTORY = '$(pwd)/assets'" >> ~/.grip/settings.py
   ```

3. Export all your Markdown files with Grip and replace absolute asset paths with relative paths:

   ```console
   $ for f in *.md; do grip --export $f --no-inline; done
   $ for f in *.html; do sed -i '' "s?$GRIPURL/??g" $f; done
   ```

You can optionally compress the set of HTML files to `docs.tgz` with:

   ```console
   $ tar -czvf docs.tgz `ls | grep [\.]html$` assets
   ```

*By [Matthew R. Tanudjaja](https://github.com/mrexmelle).*


Configuration
-------------

To customize Grip, create `~/.grip/settings.py`, then add one or more of the following variables:

- `HOST`: The host to use when not provided as a CLI argument, `localhost` by default
- `PORT`: The port to use when not provided as a CLI argument, `6419` by default
- `DEBUG`: Whether to use Flask's debugger when an error happens, `False` by default
- `DEBUG_GRIP`: Prints extended information when an error happens, `False` by default
- `API_URL`: Base URL for the github API, for example that of a Github Enterprise instance. `https://api.github.com` by default
- `CACHE_DIRECTORY`: The directory, relative to `~/.grip`, to place cached assets (this gets run through the following filter: `CACHE_DIRECTORY.format(version=__version__)`), `'cache-{version}'` by default
- `AUTOREFRESH`: Whether to automatically refresh the Readme content when the file changes, `True` by default
- `STYLE_URLS`: Additional URLs that will be added to the rendered page, `[]` by default
- `QUIET`: Do not print extended information, `False` by default
- `THEME`: The theme to use, `'light'` by default. Valid values are `'light'`, `'dark'` and `'dark_dimmed'`.
- `USERNAME`: The username to use when not provided as a CLI argument, `None` by default
- `PASSWORD`: The password or [personal access token][] to use when not provided as a CLI argument (*Please don't save your passwords here.* Instead, use an access token or drop in this code [grab your password from a password manager][keychain-access]), `None` by default

Note that this is a Python file. If you see `'X' is not defined` errors, you
may have overlooked some quotes. For example:

```py
USERNAME = 'your-username'
PASSWORD = 'your-personal-access-token'
```


#### Environment variables

- `GRIPHOME`: Specify an alternative `settings.py` location, `~/.grip` by default
- `GRIPURL`: The URL of the Grip server, `/__/grip` by default

#### Advanced

This file is a normal Python script, so you can add more advanced configuration.

For example, to read a setting from the environment and provide a default value
when it's not set:

```python
PORT = os.environ.get('GRIP_PORT', 8080)
```


API
---

You can access the API directly with Python, using it in your own projects:

```python
from grip import serve

serve(port=8080)
 * Running on http://localhost:8080/
```

Run main directly:

```python
from grip import main

main(argv=['-b', '8080'])
 * Running on http://localhost:8080/
```

Or access the underlying Flask application for even more flexibility:

```python
from grip import create_app

grip_app = create_app(user_content=True)
# Use in your own app
```


### Documentation

#### serve

Runs a local server and renders the Readme file located
at `path` when visited in the browser.

### Classes

#### class Grip(Flask)

A Flask application that can serve a file or directory containing a README.

```python
Grip(source=None, auth=None, renderer=None, assets=None, render_wide=None, render_inline=None, title=None, autorefresh=None, quiet=None, grip_url=None, static_url_path=None, instance_path=None, **kwargs)
```

##### default_renderer

Returns the default renderer using the current config. This is only used if
renderer is set to None in the constructor.

```python
Grip.default_renderer()
```

##### default_asset_manager

Returns the default asset manager using the current config. This is only used
if asset_manager is set to None in the constructor.

```python
Grip.default_asset_manager()
```

##### add_content_types

Adds the application/x-font-woff and application/octet-stream content types if
they are missing. Override to add additional content types on initialization.

```python

```

##### clear_cache

Clears the downloaded assets.

```python
Grip.clear_cache()
```

##### render

when visiting in the browser.

```python
Grip.render(route=None)
```

- `route`: The route to render, `/` by default

##### run

Starts a server to render the README. This calls [Flask.run][] internally.

```python
Grip.run(host=None, port=None, debug=None, use_reloader=None, open_browser=False)
```

- `host`: The hostname to listen on. Set this to `'0.0.0.0'` to have the server
          available externally as well, `'localhost'` by default
- `port`: The port of the webserver. Defaults to `6419`
- `debug`: If given, enable or disable debug mode. See [Flask.debug][].
- `use_reloader`: Should the server automatically restart the python process
                  if modules were changed? `False` by default unless the
                  `DEBUG_GRIP` setting is specified.
- `open_browser`: Opens the browser to the address when the server starts

Raised when the specified Readme could not be found.

```python
ReadmeNotFoundError(path=None, message=None)
```


#### class ReadmeAssetManager(object)

abstract base class.

```python
ReadmeAssetManager(cache_path, style_urls=None)
```


#### class GitHubAssetManager(ReadmeAssetManager)

Manages the style and font assets rendered with Readme pages. Set cache_path to
None to disable caching.


#### class ReadmeReader(object)

Reads Readme content from a URL subpath. This is an abstract base class.

```python
ReadmeReader()
```


#### class DirectoryReader(ReadmeReader)

Reads Readme files from URL subpaths.

```python
DirectoryReader(path=None, silent=False)
```


#### class TextReader(ReadmeReader)

Reads Readme content from the provided unicode string.

```python
TextReader(text, display_filename=None)
```


#### class StdinReader(TextReader)

Reads Readme text from STDIN.

```python
StdinReader(display_filename=None)
```


#### class ReadmeRenderer(object)

Renders the Readme. This is an abstract base class.

```python
ReadmeRenderer(user_content=None, context=None)
```


#### class GitHubRenderer(ReadmeRenderer)

Renders the specified Readme using the GitHub Markdown API.

```python
GitHubRenderer(user_content=None, context=None, api_url=None, raw=None)
```


#### class OfflineRenderer(ReadmeRenderer)

Renders the specified Readme locally using pure Python. Note: This is currently
an incomplete feature.

```python
OfflineRenderer(user_content=None, context=None)
```


### Constants


#### SUPPORTED_TITLES

The common Markdown file titles on GitHub.

```python
SUPPORTED_TITLES = ['README', 'Home']
```

- `filename`: The UTF-8 file to read.


#### SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS

The supported extensions, as defined by [GitHub][markdown].

```python
SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS = ['.md', '.markdown']
```


#### DEFAULT_FILENAMES

This constant contains the names Grip looks for when no file is provided.

```python
DEFAULT_FILENAMES = [title + ext
                     for title in SUPPORTED_TITLES
                     for ext in SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS]
```


#### DEFAULT_FILENAME

This constant contains the default Readme filename, namely:

```python
DEFAULT_FILENAME = DEFAULT_FILENAMES[0]  # README.md
```


#### DEFAULT_GRIPHOME

This constant points to the default value if the `GRIPHOME`
[environment variable](#environment-variables) is not specified.

```python
DEFAULT_GRIPHOME = '~/.grip'
```


#### DEFAULT_GRIPURL

The default URL of the Grip server and all its assets:

```python
DEFAULT_GRIPURL = '/__/grip'
```


#### DEFAULT_API_URL

The default app_url value:

```python
DEFAULT_API_URL = 'https://api.github.com'
```


Testing
-------

Install the package and test requirements:

```console
$ pip install -e .[tests]
```

Run tests with [pytest][]:

```console
$ pytest
```

Or to re-run tests as you make changes, use [pytest-watch][]:

```console
$ ptw
```


#### External assumption tests

If you're experiencing a problem with Grip, it's likely that an assumption made
about the GitHub API has been broken. To verify this, run:

```console
$ pytest -m assumption
```

Since the external assumptions rely on an internet connection, you may want to skip
them when developing locally. Tighten the cycle even further by stopping on the
first failure with `-x`:

```console
$ pytest -xm "not assumption"
```

Or with [pytest-watch][]:

```console
$ ptw -- -xm "not assumption"
```
